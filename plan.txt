Game Setup
1. Shuffle deck of cards
2. Deal 3 cards to player 1
3. Deal 3 cards to player 2
4. Deal 2 cards to player 1 (full hand)
5. Deal 2 cards to player 2 (full hand)

Game Logic
1. Player 1 plays a card
2. Player 2 has to match that card:
    a. If player 2 has a card of the same suit as player 1 card player 2 must play that card
        i. If that card has higher rank than player 1 card player 2 win's that trick
        ii. Otherwise player 1 win's the trick
    b. Else player 2 can player any other card
3. Winner of the former trick starts the next trick
4. Go to step 1 until both players exhaust all the cards in their hand
5. Winner of the last trick wins that set
